# OAT
OAT (Oval Abstract Trees) is an open-source protocol and software suite designed for cross-language compiling. The core of OAT is its sophisticated index of files, which facilitates the compilation of OATLANG code into multiple programming languages. This versatile tool aims to bridge the gap between various coding languages, enhancing interoperability and code reuse.

## Key Features:
Cross-Language Compilation: Seamlessly compile OATLANG into a variety of popular programming languages, expanding the accessibility and application of your code.
Open-Source Protocol: Fully transparent and community-driven, OAT encourages contributions and enhancements from developers worldwide.
Robust File Indexing: A comprehensive index system supports efficient management and referencing of files, crucial for large-scale and complex software development projects.
Licensing:
OAT is licensed under the Lesser GNU General Public License (LGPL), which allows the program to be freely used and modified. The LGPL ensures that all modifications and derivations of OAT remain open-source, providing the freedom to incorporate OAT into both open and proprietary software while ensuring that improvements to the core components are shared with the community.

## Community and Contributions:
We welcome contributions from developers of all backgrounds. By participating in the OAT project, you can help drive the evolution of cross-language compiling technology. Join us in our mission to make software development more flexible and inclusive!
